# Engineer Lunar Coin Fix
Kills from engineer turrets can't drop lunar coins, this mod fixes that. This does not prevent you from playing with unmodded clients since it is a bug fix. If playing multiplayer the server host must have the fix installed, and it will work for all engineers in the match.
